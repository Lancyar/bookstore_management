# bookstore_management
A simple java project in my class built on MVC Architecture using vanilla Java.
A management system allowing customers to buy books and add to their cart and store manager can manage staff accounts.

Requirements:

  Tomcat (preferably 8.5 version).
  
  SQL Server (with login account being "thanhhp" and password is "123456"/edit access to database in META-INF/context.xml).
  
  IDE Netbeans 8.2 (not really recommended, but I am used to using it).
